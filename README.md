## About node-orvibo2
node-orvibo2 is an updated version of the original [node-orvibo](http://github.com/grayda/node-orvibo). It allows you to find and control Orvibo products.

node-orvibo2 is a total rewrite. It's more modular, meaning adding new protocols and devices is a lot simpler. When it's done, it'll support "legacy" devices such as the S10 / S20 / AllOne, as well as new Orvibo products such as the Kepler, B25, Coco strip and SmartCube.

Protocol documentation is coming soon. In the meantime, check out the original node-orvibo for protocol information.
